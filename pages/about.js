        My name is Nirmal Krishna and I am a software engineer. My software
        journey started around 2008 when I was introduced to computers. Back
        then I wrote lot of tiny programs in C++ and Websites HTML,CSS. It made
        me realize that I enjoy the craft of building software.

        Using software to solve interesting problems is one of the fascinating
        things I really enjoy. Feel free to connect with me on my social media.
        I would love to hear your story!

        PS: I think in 2009 I first set my game name to `meu =D` while playing CS 1.6. <br/>
        The motivation was behind a misspelled pokemon called <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/mewtwo">meutwo</a> and <i>=D</i> is supposed to be an <a href="https://emojipedia.org/grinning-face-with-big-eyes/">emoji</a>. 
        In lot of spaces where they don`t allow special character in usernames, you would find me as meu<i>equals</i>D
