        My name is Nirmal Krishna and I am a software engineer. My software
        journey started around 2008 when I was introduced to computers. Back
        then I wrote lot of tiny programs in C++ and Websites HTML,CSS. It made
        me realize that I enjoy the craft of building software.

        Using software to solve interesting problems is one of the fascinating
        things I really enjoy. Feel free to connect with me on my social media.
        I would love to hear your story!
